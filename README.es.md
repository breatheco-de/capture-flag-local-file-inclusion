# CASINO LFI - Dangerous Inclusion in the Casino Server

In this lab, you will analyze a seemingly simple online casino webpage, detect a local file inclusion (LFI) vulnerability, and access a hidden file containing a flag. In this lab, you will learn:

- Exploring URL parameters
- Detecting LFI vulnerabilities
- Manipulating relative paths
- Accessing internal system files
- Reading flags from the web server

## ðŸ“„ Instructions

You are facing the website of a fictional casino called **Casino Royale**. Your task is to analyze how the page is built and discover if there is any vulnerability in the use of paths and files.

1. **Discover the IP address of the CASINO LFI machine.**: The machine is connected to the same network as you, but its IP has not been provided. Use tools like `nmap`, `netdiscover`, or `arp-scan` to scan the network.

2. **Access the website hosted on the server.**
   - Open your browser and visit the assigned IP.
   - Observe the content displayed with:
     ```
     ?page=home
     ?page=about
     ```

3. **Explore the vulnerable parameter.**: Can you modify the value of the `page` parameter?

4. **Extract the flag's content.**

**Remember:** not every included file was meant to be seen.

Happy hacking!
